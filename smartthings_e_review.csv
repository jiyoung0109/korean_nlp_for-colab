"February 18, 2019",2,1.0,what is this new layout? why is it default left handed operation? what's with the totally garish icons on the notification area? those things don't tie in with any UI design in Galaxy devices. How can we revert back?
"September 29, 2020",1,1.0,"Won't update to become compatible with Android 11, because the os version matters for some reason and I can't control my TVs. The app should work or be marked incompatible."
"November 29, 2018",1,,"Another step backwards by Smartthings. This has left me unable to control devices that the previous app had no trouble with. Do not buy into the Smartthings infrastructure, Google/Amazon are making it obsolete."

"November 16, 2020",1,,"The app says ""Can't connect. Check your network connection, then try again."" It says if I'm on 5ghz wifi, 2.4ghz wifi or on mobile data. Actually I can't start using it."

"January 3, 2020",4,,Just starting to notice how easy it is to do smart things in home to help with the everyday routine of even turning things on or off. Not a bad idea to use this app as much as possible.

"November 18, 2019",1,,"I can't use it, it ask me to use my Google account, but when I press the ""continue"" button it doesn't do anything. I bought a Samsung screen to use it with smartThings, I'm so sad."

"November 26, 2018",4,,Great app and works great with my Samsung smart TV and Samsung Note 9 but would be a lot more useful if I had other Samsung devices cuz my phone and TV already communicate with each other but it does allow me to control both simultaneously if I ever need to.
"May 5, 2021",1,,Very glitchy soundbar feature still not added. Every time you doing that day it breaks even worse.

"June 28, 2020",4,21.0,I've noticed the app stability and connection are much better than previous versions of the app for controlling our TV. Looking forward to being able to rely on the app as a TV remote.

"December 19, 2019",3,,Overall the product is great. The smartthings ecosystem is reliable and easy to use. The app itself is what brings my rating to 3 instead of 4 or even 5
"November 29, 2020",1,1.0,This pre-installed app is yet another non essential that unfortunately can't be uninstalled from my tablet to free up space needed for other devices of my choice. Perhaps the uninstall option should be considered by developers when putting several apps on devices which are not necessary at all.
"June 20, 2021",4,,Works perfectly. But sometimes it shows an error as well rare cases.
"December 1, 2019",1,,Unable to sign in due to browser incompatibility regardless of what browser is installed or set as default. This app becomes very useless without being able to sign in. This is on a Google Pixel 3.

"July 31, 2019",4,1.0,I'm extremely happy with the app. The only thing I would like to see changed is the length of time it takes the app to recognize/update the status of my door lock. Whether it's locked or unlocked
"March 31, 2020",1,,The camera or the app dont work. It never detects a person when it's a person. When its a tree branch in the wind or rain it says its a person. The SmartThings camera is a waste of money.
"September 30, 2020",1,2.0,So I downloaded this App to turn on my TV Samsung and it works ONLY if the TV is turned on ... So what's the point if I have to get up and turn on my TV? At least I can turn it off 😝 ... My main purpose was to TURN ON THE TV 😒

"July 18, 2019",1,1.0,app keeps gliching and wont ket me turn on my tv has been doing this for days its getting to be quite ridiculous I lost my remote and this is the only way I have to control my tv please fix and I will give you a better review in a few days
"December 29, 2018",1,,Unhelpful app. In supported models it contains ww90m645opx but always must re-register the device each time to see it connected in the app and no control features just monitoring. Thus no smart control feature in this product!!!
"March 5, 2021",5,1.0,Context switching between headphones and phone's speaker is as intuitive as it can be. I'm amazed at how SmartThings was required for something which should have been baked into the OS itself.
"October 16, 2019",4,,"After the update, the app stopped finding my roku. But before the latest update it would easily find it and worked great at connecting my phone to the roku."
"February 24, 2021",5,,"The app is very easy to use, and there are instructions for everything if you are not sure. I use it to operate my Samsung tv at time but it is able to operate a number of things. Highly recommended app especially if you are a Samsung user."
"January 29, 2020",5,,Great feature. But you guys need to fix the notification sounds when a bluetooth is connected. The notifications used to come through both bluetooth and phone not any more since the One Ui update
"September 15, 2020",1,,Don't know what happened but app is unusable. Asking me to download an add on. Press download. Says couldn't download. Been happening for over a week now.
"January 13, 2021",5,1.0,Amazing app to use! Especially when you cant find your TV remote. Always something new. Easy and fast as well. Just amazing!
"February 7, 2021",3,,Would be much better if the remote was user friendly. The 4d pad is awful and I can't scroll through shows and click on them I have to use the regular remote to select shows.
"March 10, 2019",5,1.0,We love this app its easy to use. my dog chewed up the remote control first week after we got our tv. No biggie this app did the job while a new one was shipped
"September 20, 2020",1,1.0,The most recent upgrade destroyed all my Alexa routines! Give us an option to install the version before the update. I am thinking to stop using smartthings all together at this point.
"March 24, 2021",1,,"Useless, cant change the WiFi so now I can't play music from it. Spent an hour looking at every setting and there's no way to change it. Very expensive speaker that can't be used"
"August 22, 2020",1,,"App will not run on Bluestacks or my Ipad. Unfortunately, I migrated to this version from the old one that worked fine before I knew that. I am very unhappy!"
"April 10, 2019",1,,Utterly useless. Continually redirects to message about browser compatibility. Despite following instructions issue remains. Complete waste of time.
"December 28, 2018",3,,"Can't use the mouse. Have to go to the phone and press ""send"", etc. Only for sound and keyboard. Enter does nothing."
"September 19, 2020",1,,"Lots of things broken (alarm, next protector), and for some reason, samsung insists my country is Italy without allowing me to change it. There is also no way (?) to migrate back. Such a bad experience."
"October 3, 2018",5,,This app helps you connect your Samsung devices. It's flawless and smooth. Just tap and connect. Worth the 5 stars.
"April 25, 2020",4,,"I was hesitant to update from Classic since the new one seemed more limited but now that I've committed, I'm pretty happy with it. I had to install webCoRE to get the level of automation I wanted though."
"February 9, 2021",2,1.0,"It doesn't seem to act on the requests I make, for instance turning off external audio devices to phone. I still have to manually do that."
"October 27, 2018",1,2.0,"Cant uninstall and it is now asking for more permissions. If you try to uninstall, it breaks something and you get frequent pop ups saying smartthings isn't working. Pretty lame"
"February 18, 2019",1,1.0,"latest forced update wiped all my rooms, all settings, and then made me save every device twice to generic rooms before letting me into the menu, and completely wrecked my automation routines."
"February 9, 2021",5,1.0,"Probably the best smart remote out there, essentially just as usable as the regular remote. Would appreciate the ability to use a qwerty keyboard in app to type on the TV."
"May 19, 2020",5,1.0,Compare to Wink it's a lot easier to use and setup automations. UI is a lot smoother too. Thanks for all the hard work!

"December 2, 2019",5,,"Long time user of v2 hubs. New app UX is much more polished than Classic, but just takes some time to refamiliarize new terms where they are different from the Classic app."
"October 1, 2020",4,1.0,Overall Good. There could be a more direct access to the forget function. The automation capabilities are a little bit limited
"December 30, 2020",4,,Originally failed to work on pixel 3 with new Samsung Q70 sound bar. Smart things advises to download add an app which then failed. However Samsung have now issued a fix and all good.
"October 7, 2020",4,,Only complaint I have is when playing 2 devices at the same time...its not synced or as seamless as it should be...other than that good app.
"March 8, 2020",5,,Automated 2 smart locks and a host of other different devices into Alexa in just a few taps of the screen! Simple. Diverse. Powerful. Highly recommended!
"June 18, 2019",1,,"It never works for me, once it found my tv after and before that, it never found it, I gave up and uninstalled it."
"December 29, 2020",1,3.0,"Latest update on this terrible app now requires you to accept a new lengthy privacy policy so that can collect even more data on you. Shame, Samsung, for forcing us here to this ""new"" app just to push this forced policy. Time to ditch this buggy ecosystem."
"November 25, 2020",5,,Beautiful. Love how seamless the design is. And how magical things interwoven to create a beautiful experience. Tempting one to get more smart things.

"October 2, 2018",1,,I can't connect my washer to the app. spoke to Samsung several times who insist it is an app problem. 3 months and it's still an app problem. so this app doesn't work.
"April 28, 2020",3,3.0,"Why can't I stream content to my tv anymore? Only the mirror screen option is available.. what happened to the ""play content"" option so I could still use my phone whilst playing content?...why do you guys always go backwards"
"June 29, 2020",1,7.0,"The app isn't even on my phone after download! Nowhere to be found. I have to go back to the play store to open it! The control layout is just nonsense, not user friendly at all! One of the most useless apps ever. 👎"
"March 14, 2020",3,,"I like the app, but I do not like the fact that I can't play my music from more than one speaker at a time. And if I can it does not give me simple enough instructions on how to do so."
"January 11, 2020",5,,"Amazing, I love being able to connect my tv to my phone. The fact that I can let the tv sound play on my phone and he just use earplugs, very cool"
"September 26, 2019",5,,I use it all the time. Great. Only one little issue keep on getting a pop up on my phone to say connectivity unstable. But connectivity is perfect
"March 1, 2021",1,,Why is it so difficult to connect a Samsung TV with SmartThings capability to a Samsung Note 10? This shouldn't be this hard and shouldn't take this long.

"September 27, 2019",1,1.0,"Smart Lock Guest Access doesn't work on my Pxel with Android 10. I cannot create codes for my Zwave smart lock. Wink may not be as advanced, but at least it works."
"November 21, 2018",2,11.0,The latest release screwed up the status bar display - it's all blank. How does this obvious of an error escape? Is there no regression testing Samsung???

"March 25, 2021",5,3.0,Easy control of connection and disconnect with my hearing aids.
"February 15, 2020",1,1.0,Possibly worst app I have come across on iOS and Android. Words fail how such a large 'organisation' could.produce such absolute garbage. Must have been done by 'bring your kids to work for a day' kids.
"May 2, 2019",5,5.0,absolutely love this app!! it has truly changed the way i see and use technology all the way around. for once tech is finally easy enough with Smart Things app that all of my family uses it everyday! Great job guys keep up the awsome work.
"October 30, 2020",1,,ZERO STARS! Updating it crashed my phone so hard I couldn't get more than a blue screen for 20 minutes! Worst. App. Ever.
"November 18, 2019",2,,Push notifications sound reverts to phones notification sound when update was performed on the app. Really like to be able to have different sounds for text messages and door alerts.
"October 10, 2018",5,,"couldnt give 6 stars. never seems to fail, you've outdone yourself yet again Samsung. for being user friendly, easy to comprehend, and up to date. 5 thumbs up."
"September 26, 2019",5,1.0,They have come a long way with the in app experiance. I enjoy using all functions available. The most seamless smart home experiance I have used yet between software and hard wear.

"October 20, 2020",1,17.0,Device is added via the work flow but does not show up in the devices list. Seriously considering moving to Nest for a far better integration experience. Not having an update ready ahead of major releases is a rookie move.

"October 17, 2018",5,,Have several devices connected. All of which work as expected. One app to controll everything is great. Nice work developer.
"October 10, 2020",1,,Why did they change the Samsung screen share app. The other one worked so seamlessly. This is so difficult. I'm constantly having to uninstall it
"September 13, 2019",5,,Super useful and simple to use. Most complaints from others are probably due to their bad wifi or hardware they are trying to connect to having the issues.
"October 9, 2018",4,,Trying to open the tv from both my galaxy watch and the top draw bar is not working. The only solution is to enter the app itself. Funny thing is that it works to shut it off from both sides
"October 14, 2018",5,,Great App. I didn't find it useful until my smart remote broke. I should jave used ot from the start. Tv UE49KS7000 Controls more than just my TV.

"September 22, 2018",1,,"It just popped as as needing an update. I didn't even know it was on my tab. When I came to find out what it is, it says it's not compatible with my device, but there's no option to uninstall it. That's absolutely not cool"
"July 4, 2020",4,3.0,Finally they brought back the output selection notification when connected to multiple Bluetooth devices. I don't actively use the app for much else oddly enough.
"November 28, 2019",4,17.0,This app is super useful the only thing it needs is to have the lighting groups be an icon in the status bar instead of having to use each device separately or having to open the app to be able to turn groups off. It would make it a lot more convenient.
"February 17, 2021",1,,Used to work fine but since the last update cannot get it to connect to my TV. Says its offline constantly. Uninstalled and reinstalled but no better. Disappointing

"March 12, 2021",5,1.0,"Great concept, some flawed execution. Mostly nice. I love managing all of my Bluetooth devices in one place, however the AirDrop-like feature has a tendency to not work. Most of the time, it waits for acceptance on my end while the prompt never pops up on my wife's phone."

"December 14, 2019",1,,Step in the wrong direction. Do yourself a favor and use the classic app. This one is slow to navigate if you have more than a few rooms or devices.
"August 28, 2020",1,,"It says drag down notification a panel and you will get a option for smart view or go to edit to find it. There is no such option. Even in the samsung youtube video, it was said that it will have screen sharing option but in the app i couldn't find one."

"December 16, 2018",1,,For probably 99% of us this battery draining app is totally useless and on my Samsung it seems impossible to remove so the Samsung will be on Kijiji and I'll be quite pleased to go back to my LG for now.
"November 30, 2020",2,2.0,Screen sharing needs improvement/options to be able to turn off certain things on the screen for example like notifications.I was playing a movie and got a txt across the screen from an ex and it was clear as day.
"June 25, 2019",5,1.0,it makes it much easier to manage my connected devices. it also is nice that i can chose which device plays the audio so i can have headphones and a speaker connected and chose which one plays.

"August 13, 2019",4,,The app is good but the addition of playing the same audio on two or more devices simultaneously would make this even better.
"May 9, 2019",1,1.0,Apparently it has been hacked but no data was compromised. Can not remove some of the preinstalled applications so this is worrying as one of the applications is run by the Zucker.

"January 8, 2020",5,,i use my devices all the time so a quick k swipe and I can adjust my audio and still be able to be connected and reconnected at please.
"May 2, 2020",3,,"Was working great, but for some reason the swipe box isn't working. Trying to figure out how to fix it."
"December 29, 2020",1,,This app is terrible. Not intuitive. I bought a Samsung smart tv. I cant even connect it and control it using this app.
"June 25, 2020",3,,"Device sometimes takes a while to connect or turn on, only shows you the list of connected devices."
"March 13, 2021",1,,"Never used this, don't even know what it is supposed to do. Shall not be using this. Like the ads, I hit delete or skip whenever possible."
"January 3, 2021",1,,"Downloaded to control new samsung tv. Where is the keyboard option? Pretty useless without, as using tv remote to type things in is extremely frustrating. Would have thought keyboard for this app would be a main consideration:("
"March 8, 2020",1,1.0,"What a worst application, since the update I can't mirroring my smartphone to TV ,because isn't supported anymore, my TV type is UA39FH5003R, Please make Good Update not make it more WORST THAN EVER"
"November 6, 2019",1,,The app looks great but lacks functionality from the classic app. How many years will it take before full functionality is carried. What is going on over there??!
"December 20, 2020",3,,Ease of use and adding things to the network works MOST TIMES works pretty seamlessly. Automations work less often than they should.
"November 6, 2019",4,,Works with a few devices that don't natively support Google Cast for every app. A good app to have preloaded on your device.
"September 17, 2019",5,,Should be no stars as the latest update has broken the app to be unusable when using Android 10. Update finally works with Android 10.
"September 9, 2019",5,,SmartThings is a very useful app/feature that makes me not feel as disappointed about the newer galaxies not having the IR blaster anymore. Thanks to the developers for giving its user a classy and convenient experience.
"September 5, 2020",2,,Suddenly started crashing badly after restarting the phone. Kept crashing even after force stoping it. Had to uninstall and install it again.
"December 18, 2018",1,1.0,Seems to have not allowed me to bluetooth with my car. Been having trouble with that and it uses a lot of battery power.
"November 18, 2020",1,,As always even after several updates is a nightmare to control the Samsung TV with the Samsung Galaxy phone the application is unresponsive all the time
"August 21, 2021",5,,Very stable and easy home automation
"February 21, 2019",4,1.0,Once you master the quirks it is a pretty powerful home automation system. This took the place of Lowe's failed Iris product.
"February 19, 2021",5,,"I love the app. Please make it available for the Samsung Galaxy A21. (I had it on my A20, but it does not appear to be available on my A21) Thx."
"April 14, 2019",4,,"The app layout isn't all that intuitive, but once I figured out how to use then I loved the features."
"July 30, 2020",4,1.0,Still a little glitchy but working a lot better since I uninstalled and reinstalled. Plus clearing data on bluetooth helps as well.
"August 25, 2020",1,1.0,"Ever since i managed to link to the tv for the very first time. Subsequent, always reset and unable to discover my samsung tv."

"September 27, 2019",5,,Great app. Changes always seem positive. The more devices you add the better the functionality.
"September 21, 2020",1,3.0,Fails to download sound bar addon. Update: I contacted support as requested. Their solution was to try a non pixel phone.
"April 14, 2020",5,,I really enjoy the connectivity. Their are a few things that could be worked out and I trust they will continue to update the app.
"June 2, 2021",5,,Easy to connect.
"March 1, 2021",1,,"App has stopped working, constantly says cannot connect to internet please retry. Tried clearing cache and reinstalling. Did not help."
"February 20, 2019",1,,"The update removed all the bluetooth options from the home page, if you don't use home automation this has effectively rendered this app useless."
"September 27, 2018",5,,😀 I'm just using it to turn off/on the lights... But it can do so much more when supported accessories are added.
"December 27, 2018",1,4.0,"I refused the last update because suddenly this app requires the permission to make and monitor phone calls, it controls my speaker it has no right to make phone calls so I did not update the app, now suddenly the app has updated itself against my permissions. I did not give my permission to have th...

"December 21, 2019",4,,"i wish from SmartThings they add "" DARK MODE "" And fixing problem with delay and disconnecting in screen mirroring on TV, PLEASE Pay attention !!"
"August 21, 2020",5,1.0,Love the fact that I can access my devices and see whats connected and what isn't connected. The fact that I don't have to open my Bluetooth list just to see my devices that are connected and that I can singularly disconnect that device connected.
"August 24, 2019",4,,"Works pretty good, but there are times the remote feature says the T.V. has to be on, when it clearly is."
"November 16, 2019",1,,"Wont connect to my Samsung tv. Using samsung phone, freezes everytime it gets to wireless stage even though both tv and phone are paired to same router, same signal."

"December 14, 2019",1,,"App crashes and stops. Removed, reinstall, try to sign in and now Network and Server error. Search for devices and only offers old models.."
"January 17, 2019",1,,since this smart things came in they took the quick connect away. Now I can't use my drivemode app to choose the audio path of the phone vs the vehicle I am in.
"January 8, 2020",4,,"It is good, you can do a lot, wish if they can add more flexibility in automation more advanced logic"
